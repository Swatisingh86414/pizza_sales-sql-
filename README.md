🚀 SQL Project: Pizza Sales Analysis 🍕📊

Hey everyone! 👋 I'm excited to share my latest SQL project, where I analyzed pizza sales data to gain insights into revenue trends, customer preferences, and order patterns.

🔍 Key Insights from the Analysis:
✅ Total Sales & Revenue Trends – Identified peak sales periods 📈
✅ Best-Selling Pizza – Found out which pizza is a customer favorite! 🍕
✅ Order Frequency – Analyzed how often customers place orders
✅ Average Order Value – Assessed pricing strategies and sales performance 💰

💡 Skills Used:
🔹 SQL (GROUP BY, JOINS, CTEs, Window Functions)
🔹 Data Cleaning & Aggregation
🔹 Trend Analysis & Business Insights
📌 Check out the full project and SQL queries on my GitHub: [https://github.com/Swatisingh86414/pizza_sales-sql-/blob/main/SQLQuery%20pizza%20sql%20project.sql]

I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback! Drop a comment or message if you have any suggestions. 😊
